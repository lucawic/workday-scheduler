# Work Day Scheduler

UA Coding BootCamp\
Module Challenge #5: Work Day Scheduler (with starter code)

## Objectives

The purpose of implentating the code in this Module #5 challenge was to finish creating a workday scheduler that would allow a busy person to organize their day, hour by hour, so that they can adjust for their daily tasks, and then allocate the appropriate time to each tasks. Specifically, the user wanted to be able to use a daily planner to create a personal schedule. The app will allow the the user[I] to complete the functions as follows...
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
